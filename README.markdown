# WHAT IS THIS?

An animation library that allows app developers to run Canvas-based animations in a given amount of time.

This allows Android applications to perform animations in a manner that does not make the application feel "sluggish" which is a challenge with garbage collection and multitasking.

# WHAT IS IT NOT?

This library does not create your animations for you. You still need to implement them yourself; the library's framework helps you keep them zippy.

A sample application is provided and you can also download it from the market ('CFRAnimated'). It shows how you can subclass CFRAnimated to create your own animations.

# WHO USES THIS?

Currently, me. I use it in a yet unreleased util codenamed 'Explorer' that lets you browse your SDCard content through concentric rings, showing you which files/directories are using up the most disk space.

# HELP!

I will soon create a write-up that explains this library's structure and paradigms in depth.
